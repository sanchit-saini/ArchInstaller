# ArchInstaller
**Disclaimer: These scripts are for me, but might be useful for you too.**

**âš  Warning  : This script wipes whole device.**


ArchInstaller is a set of bash script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures fully functional DE/WM, By default ArchInstaller script install i3wm and uses my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sanchit-saini/dotfiles).

## Customization
If you don't want to use default [dotfiles](https://github.com/sanchit-saini/dotfiles), then these functions should be updated accordingly along with `packages.csv` file & `DOTFIlES` in config file
```
post.sh :
    install_and_configure_git_repos()
    configure()
    clean()
```
The script is written in a functional way for easier readability, everything should be self-explanatory.
If in a case you are still facing any problem you know what to do create an issue!
